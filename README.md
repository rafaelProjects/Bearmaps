# Bearmaps
Web mapping application of Berkeley inspired by Google Maps. This application can handle features such as query autocomplete responses by using a Trie data structure, place searching, map displaying, zooming in/out, and finding the shortest path between user-inputted points with the help of the A* algorithm. A KD Tree was used to parse through locations in Î˜ (log N) time demonstrated by completing one thousand queries in under five milliseconds. Written in Java.
